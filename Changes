Revision history for Perl extension Test::Without::Module.

Todo:
  - Add way to allow only core modules (suggested by SREZIC)

0.10 20080804
  - Added missing File::Slurp prerequisite. Thanks to ANDK and
    the CPAN smoke testers to alert me to this
  - No functional changes. No upgrade from 0.09 is necessary.

0.09 20061231
  - Added more consistency tests
  - Added Jerrad Pierce to the list of those
    who mentioned the command line use. I forgot
    the usage NUFFIN had given, so both were
    genuinely new to me.

0.08 20061229
  - Removed superfluous File::Temp usage from module

0.07 20061229
  - No more inline pod tests
  - No code changes since 0.06

0.06 20030320
  - fixed the inline test pod
  - Now needs Test::Pod 0.95 (or skips the pod test)

0.03 20030217
  - Released on CPAN
  - Fixes so the pod for the fake module doesn't appear
    in the main pod.
